The goal of the entire endeavour was to create a more engaging and inclusive storytelling experience around the interview format.

We worked under the premise that we can achieve that by letting the readers directly interact with the characters at the heart of a story. All through one-on-one message exchanges. Our work on InterviewJS involved creation of four different packages, each living its own life in a dedicated environment:

1. The Story Composer — the only area protected by an authentication provider where story creators can sign in to manage, compose, edit and publish their stories.
2. The Story Viewer — used to render published stories. It takes dataset of a story created by the journalist and renders it as a navigable, interactive chat application.
3. The Style-guide running on Catalog — a “living” design documentation and front-end architecture reference.
4. The public-facing website: https://interviewjs.io

I had the pleasure to lead user experience design and front-end development on the project.
